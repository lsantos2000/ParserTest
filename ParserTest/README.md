# ParserTest
 Coding challenge

See Program.cs

           // Problem:
            // Update StringParser Parse() method so it would return list of substrings from the supplied input string.
            // Each substring should be continuous sequence of alphanumeric characters.
            // The sample TEST_DATA are given above, please feel free to extend it if neccessary.
            // The current implementation passes 4 first cases but fails the rest.
            // Please ensure the implementation is production quality- simple, easy to maintain, doesn't allocate unnecessary memory and has performance O(n) where n- length of the input string. The current implementation does not meet these requirements.
